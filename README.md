# Objective
The shift to remote and hybrid work has transformed how people collaborate. Yet, many individuals still find themselves juggling multiple apps and calendars, leading to missed meetings, scheduling conflicts, and challenges in balancing professional tasks with personal commitments. 
This prototype targets four key user groups: remote professionals, freelancers, hybrid workers, and students or academic researchers. Their primary tasks include scheduling meetings, communicating seamlessly with colleagues, arranging workspaces for in-person sessions, and collaboratively managing shared notes and ongoing discussions. The proposed solution integrates these tasks into a single application, aiming to streamline workflows and enhance productivity.
